			<div class='para' id='paraColumn'>
				Polymer matrix composites are traditionally valued for use in <b>lightweight mechanical</b> applications (aerospace, automotive, etc.) due to their attractive combination of mechanical properties (<b>toughness</b>, <b>strength/stiffness</b>) and <b>low density</b>. For use in <b>extreme environments</b>, these materials must possess <b>slow degradation rates when exposed to O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and salts</b>. Moreover,  maintaining structural integrity over a wide temperature range requires a low thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between matrix/reinforcement and a high <b>glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>)</b>. Composites must also demonstrate excellent <b>resistance to fracture</b>, determined in part by the mechanical properties (described above) and by the preferred <b>failure mode</b>, which is a function of the <b>reinforcement architecture</b> and <b>fiber/matrix interface</b>. The <b>polymer matrix</b> <b>is prepared</b> by combining epoxy, crosslinker, and filler (as-needed), which controls the <b>crosslinking density</b> and <b>heterogeneity</b> within the matrix structure. <b>The choice and preparation of reinforcement</b> sets the <b>morphology</b> and <b>microstructure of the reinforcement phase</b>.  The architecture of the reinforcement (and therefore, composite) is set during <b>layup and curing</b> and is defined by the <b>dispersion</b>, <b>aggregation</b>, and <b>orientation of the reinforcement</b>. <b>Post-layup annealing and aging</b> can improve the <b>matrix/reinforcement interface</b>, and is critical to the mechanical properties, particularly the <b>failure mode</b> and <b>toughness</b>.
